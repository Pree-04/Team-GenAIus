FWC Support Policy  
1. Overview  
Unless otherwise stated, these Support Policies apply to on -site and off -site support for all 
service lines.  
“You” and “your” refer to the individual or entity that has ordered support from FWC or an 
FWC -authorized distributor.  
All programs must be licensed to receive support provided by FWC Support Services 
(“FSS”) as described in these FWC Service Support Policies. Dedicated support is provided 
for issues (including problems you create) that are demonstrable in the currently su pported 
release(s) of the FWC licensed program, running unaltered, and on certified services, MSP, 
and service latency, as specified in your order or program documentation.  
2. Support Terms  
Support Period  
Support is effective upon the effective date of your order unless stated otherwise in your 
order. Unless otherwise stated in the order, FWC Service support terms, including pricing, 
reflect a 12 -month support period (the “support period”). Once placed, you r call for support 
services is non -cancelable and the sums paid are non -refundable, except as provided in the 
relevant order. FWC is not obligated to provide support beyond the end of the support period.  
Contacting FWC Support  
Support requests must be submitted via the FWC in -website support system. If the in -website 
support is unavailable, an email with a detailed issue description may be sent to the FWC 
Support contact listed in your Order Form.  
Your service contacts are the s ole liaisons between you and FSS for service support services.  
Your Service contacts must have, at a minimum, initial basic staffing and vendor relationship 
knowledge and, as needed, supplemental training appropriate for specific roles or 
implementation p hases.  
Your support contacts must be knowledgeable about the FWC -supported programs and your 
FWC environments to help resolve service issues and assist FWC in analyzing and resolving 
service requests.  
When submitting a service request, your Service contact  should have a baseline 
understanding of the problem you are encountering and an ability to provide a detailed 
description of the problem with evidence and supporting materials to assist FWC in 
diagnosing and triaging the problem.  
To avoid interruptions in  support services, you must notify FSS whenever Service contact 
responsibilities are transferred to another individual.  
You may designate one (1) primary and two (2) backup individuals (“Service contact”) to 
serve as liaisons with FSS.  
Your primary Service  contact shall be responsible for overseeing your service request activity 
and the backup Service contacts shall be responsible for overseeing the request activity in the 
primary individual’s absence.  
FWC may review service requests logged by your Service contacts and may recommend 
specific training to help avoid service requests that would be prevented by such training.  
Page 2:
3. FWC Service Support Levels  
You will automatically receive updates to the FWC system, including:  
• Service updates, fixes, security alerts, and critical patch updates.  
• Major product and technology releases, if and when made available at FWC’s 
discretion, which may include general maintenance releases, selected functionality 
releases, and documentation updates.  
• Access to the customer support systems in the FWC application, including the ability 
to log service requests online, unless stated otherwise.  
• Non-Service customer service during normal business hours.  
• The Software License, Updates & Support described above.  
First Line Support (Level 1)  
For your support requests, FWC will use reasonable efforts to respond to service requests per 
the Response Time Goals outlined in the guidelines below; however, FWC’s failure to adhere 
to the times stated will not constitute a breach by FWC. The guidelines  are for informational 
purposes only and are subject to change at FWC’s discretion.  
Update of Resolution  
• Critical  – Resource Unavailability or Absence: 2 hours / Same day  
• High  – Serious business impact: 2 hours / 24 hours  
• Medium  – Moderate business impact: 4 hours / 2 -5 days  
• Low  – Limited business impact: 24 hours / TBD based on priority  
4. Priority Definitions  
Service requests for supported FWC programs may be submitted by you online through 
FWC’s in -app customer support system. If the in -website system is unavailable, you may 
reach the Service contact in your contract by email. The service request priority leve l is 
selected by you and FWC and should be based on the priority definitions specified below.  
• Priority – Critical  
Your production use of the supported programs has stopped or is so severely impacted 
that you cannot reasonably continue work. You experience a complete loss of service. 
The operation is mission critical to the business, and the situation is an emergency. A 
critical priority service request has one or more of the following characteristics:  
o A critical criminal crime or legal eviction  
o The Resource backs off without prior notice  
o Repeated malpractices or breaking the code of conduct at the client' place  
Reasonable efforts will be made to respond to critical priority service requests 
within two (2) hours. Except as otherwise specified, FWC provides 24 -hour 
support for critical prior ity service requests. You must provide FSS with a 
contact during this 24×7 period, either on -site or by phone, to assist with data 
gathering, investigation, and report making. You are requested to propose this 
Page 3:
priority classification with great care, so that valid critical priority situations 
obtain the necessary resource allocation from FWC.  
• Priority – High  
You experience a severe loss of service. Important features are unavailable with no 
acceptable workaround; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion.  
• Priority – Medium  
You experience a minor loss of service. The impact is an inconvenience, which may 
require a workaround to restore functionality, and may affect certain agreements and 
organization times.  
• Priority – Low  
You request information, an enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding 
your software but there is no impact on the operation of the software. You experience 
no loss of service. The result does not impede the operation of a system.
