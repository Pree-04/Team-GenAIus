**FWC Support Policy**

**Overview**

Unless otherwise stated, these Support Policies apply to on-site and off-site support for all service lines.

“You” and “your” refer to the individual or entity that has ordered support from FWC or an FWC-authorized distributor.

All programs must be licensed to receive support provided by FWC Support Services (“FSS”) as described in these FWC Service Support Policies. Dedicated support is provided for issues (including problems you create) that are demonstrable in the currently supported release(s) of the FWC licensed program, running unaltered, and on certified services, MSP, and service latency, as specified in your order or program documentation.

**Support Terms**

**Support Period**

Support is effective upon the effective date of your order unless stated otherwise in your order. Unless otherwise stated in the order, FWC Service support terms, including pricing, reflect a 12-month support period (the “support period”). Once placed, your call for support services is non-cancelable and the sums paid are non-refundable, except as provided in the relevant order. FWC is not obligated to provide support beyond the end of the support period.

**Contacting FWC Support**

Support requests must be submitted via the FWC in-website support system. If the in-website support is unavailable, an email with a detailed issue description may be sent to the FWC Support contact listed in your Order Form.

Your service contacts are the sole liaisons between you and FSS for service support services.

Your Service contacts must have, at a minimum, initial basic staffing and vendor relationship knowledge and, as needed, supplemental training appropriate for specific roles or implementation phases.

Your support contacts must be knowledgeable about the FWC-supported programs and your FWC environments to help resolve service issues and assist FWC in analyzing and resolving service requests.

When submitting a service request, your Service contact should have a baseline understanding of the problem you are encountering and an ability to provide a detailed description of the problem with evidence and supporting materials to assist FWC in diagnosing and triaging the problem.

To avoid interruptions in support services, you must notify FSS whenever Service contact responsibilities are transferred to another individual.

You may designate one (1) primary and two (2) backup individuals (“Service contact”) to serve as liaisons with FSS.

Your primary Service contact shall be responsible for overseeing your service request activity and the backup Service contacts shall be responsible for overseeing the request activity in the primary individual’s absence.

FWC may review service requests logged by your Service contacts and may recommend specific training to help avoid service requests that would be prevented by such training.

**FWC Service Support Levels**

You will automatically receive updates to the FWC system, including:

* Service updates, fixes, security alerts, and critical patch updates.
* Major product and technology releases, if and when made available at FWC’s discretion, which may include general maintenance releases, selected functionality releases, and documentation updates.
* Access to the customer support systems in the FWC application, including the ability to log service requests online, unless stated otherwise.
* Non-Service customer service during normal business hours.
* The Software License, Updates & Support described above.

**First Line Support (Level 1)**

For your support requests, FWC will use reasonable efforts to respond to service requests per the Response Time Goals outlined in the guidelines below; however, FWC’s failure to adhere to the times stated will not constitute a breach by FWC. The guidelines are for informational purposes only and are subject to change at FWC’s discretion.

**Update of Resolution**

* **Critical** – Resource Unavailability or Absence: 2 hours / Same day
* **High** – Serious business impact: 2 hours / 24 hours
* **Medium** – Moderate business impact: 4 hours / 2-5 days
* **Low** – Limited business impact: 24 hours / TBD based on priority

**Priority Definitions**

Service requests for supported FWC programs may be submitted by you online through FWC’s in-app customer support system. If the in-website system is unavailable, you may reach the Service contact in your contract by email. The service request priority level is selected by you and FWC and should be based on the priority definitions specified below.

* **Priority – Critical**
Your production use of the supported programs has stopped or is so severely impacted that you cannot reasonably continue work. You experience a complete loss of service. The operation is mission critical to the business, and the situation is an emergency. A critical priority service request has one or more of the following characteristics:

    * A critical criminal crime or legal eviction
    * The Resource backs off without prior notice
    * Repeated malpractices or breaking the code of conduct at the client’s place

Reasonable efforts will be made to respond to critical priority service requests within two (2) hours. Except as otherwise specified, FWC provides 24-hour support for critical priority service requests. You must provide FSS with a contact during this 24×7 period, either on-site or by phone, to assist with data gathering, investigation, and report making. You are requested to propose this priority classification with great care, so that valid critical priority situations obtain the necessary resource allocation from FWC.

* **Priority – High**
You experience a severe loss of service. Important features are unavailable with no acceptable workaround; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion.

* **Priority – Medium**
You experience a minor loss of service. The impact is an inconvenience, which may require a workaround to restore functionality, and may affect certain agreements and organization times.

* **Priority – Low**
You request information, an enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding your software but there is no impact on the operation of the software. You experience no loss of service. The result does not impede the operation of a system.

    * Gemini Model: By using Gemini, we will implement function calling mechanisms that allow the system to interact with real-time APIs without exposing sensitive information. This model supports large language models (LLMs) that can effectively perform real-time data retrieval without the typical limitations associated with traditional models.
    * Tenant Project Architecture: The architecture will be designed to accommodate tenant-based implementations, where different tenants (or clients) can utilize the system while ensuring that their data remains separate and secure. Each tenant will have distinct access controls, allowing for customized experiences while maintaining robust data protection measures.
    * Reasoning Engine: A robust reasoning engine will be integrated to facilitate logical processing and decision-making capabilities. This engine will analyze user queries in real-time and determine the best course of action, ensuring that responses are both accurate and contextually relevant.
    * Multi-Agent System: The multi-agent framework will allow multiple instances of the chatbot to operate concurrently, each handling different aspects of user queries. This design will enable the system to respond more effectively to a variety of requests simultaneously, enhancing overall responsiveness and user satisfaction.
    * Data Security: Utilizing Vertex AI not only supports efficient data processing but also strengthens data security protocols. The implementation of stringent privacy measures will ensure that confidential information remains protected during API calls and data exchanges, adhering to the principles of tenant-based security.
    * Exploring Functionality: As we dive deeper into the integration of Vertex AI, we will explore how it can support additional functionalities, such as:
        * Natural language understanding for more nuanced user interactions.
        * Advanced contextual awareness, allowing the model to retain and refer to past conversations while respecting privacy constraints.
        * Enhanced feedback mechanisms for continuous learning and improvement.
    * These initiatives represent a significant step forward in enhancing the functionality, security, and user experience of the GenAIus KT system. By prioritizing real-time data access and the protection of confidential information, we are committed to developing a robust and user-friendly knowledge management system.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import styles from './Chatbot.module.css';
import axios from 'axios';
import { AiOutlineSend } from 'react-icons/ai';

const Chatbot = () => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const messagesEndRef = useRef(null);

  const scrollToBottom = () => {
    messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  };

  useEffect(() => {

      <div className={styles.messagesContainer}>
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <div
            key={index}
            className={message.type === 'user' ? styles.userMessage : styles.botMessage}
          >
            {message.text}
          </div>
        ))}
        <div ref={messagesEndRef} />
      </div>
      <div className={styles.inputContainer}>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={input}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          onKeyPress={handleKeyPress}
          placeholder="Type your message..."
        />
        <button onClick={handleSendMessage} disabled={isLoading}>
          {isLoading ? '...' : <AiOutlineSend />}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Chatbot;
```

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Imports:**
   - **React, useState, useEffect, useRef:**  Essential React hooks for managing state, side effects, and DOM references.
   - **styles:** Import styles from `Chatbot.module.css`.
   - **axios:** For making API requests to the backend.
   - **AiOutlineSend:** A send icon from `react-icons/ai`.

2. **Chatbot Component:**
   - **State:**
     - `messages`: An array to store chat messages (both user and bot).
     - `input`: The current user input.
     - `isLoading`: Indicates whether a response is being fetched from the backend.
   - **Ref:**
     - `messagesEndRef`: A reference to the end of the messages container for scrolling.
   - **scrollToBottom Function:** Scrolls the chat window to the bottom when a new message is added.
   - **useEffect Hook:** Automatically scrolls to the bottom when `messages` changes.
   - **handleInputChange Function:** Updates the `input` state when the user types in the input field.
   - **handleSendMessage Function:**
     - Sends the user message to the backend using `axios`.
     - Displays a loading indicator while waiting for a response.
     - Updates the `messages` state with the bot's response or an error message.
     - Resets the loading state after processing.
   - **handleKeyPress Function:**  Handles Enter key press to send the message.
   - **JSX Structure:**
     - **messagesContainer:** Displays the chat messages, with different styles for user and bot messages.
     - **inputContainer:** Contains the input field and send button.

3. **Chat.js (Backend Handling):**
   - This file is responsible for handling chat requests from the frontend.
   - It uses `axios` to send the user message to the Flask API.
   - It sends back the response from the Flask bot to the frontend.

**Key Changes:**

- **Code Cleanup:** Removed unnecessary symbols, commented out irrelevant code, and improved readability.
- **Corrected Typos:** Corrected typos like `new -chat` to `new-chat` and `chat -history` to `chat-history`.
- **Added Comments:** Explanatory comments were added to explain each function and component.
- **Improved Structure:** The code is organized better with clear functions and component separation.
- **Simplified Error Handling:** Simplified error handling in `handleSendMessage` to focus on the core functionality.

**Note:** This code is a basic example. You'll need to adapt it for your specific backend setup (e.g., Flask, Node.js) and integrate your own bot logic.
## Cleaned and Preprocessed Text:

**Frontend Code:**

```javascript
// ... other code ...

<div className="chat-container">
  <div className="chat-list">
    {chatHistory.map((chat, index) => (
      <div
        key={index}
        className={`chat-item ${chat.selected ? "selected" : ""}`}
        onClick={() => handleChatSelect(index)}
      >
        {chat.title}
        <button onClick={() => handleDeleteChat(index)}>Delete</button>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
  {/* New Chat Button */}
  <button onClick={handleNewChat}>New Chat</button>
</div>

// ... other code ... 
```

**Explanation:**

* Removed unnecessary spaces and line breaks.
* Corrected typo "button >" to "button" in the closing tag.
* Added a comment explaining the purpose of the "New Chat Button".
* Clarified the purpose of the "Chat List" section and its functionality.
* Improved the description of the "Delete" button.
* Included a note on conditional styling for selected chats.

## Cleaned and Preprocessed Text: 

**Function: list_models**

```python
try:
    models = genai.list_models()
    model_names = [model.name for model in models]  # Extract model names
    logging.info("Available models: " + ", ".join(model_names))
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Error listing models: {e}")

```

**Purpose:** Lists all available models from the Google Generative AI library.

**Steps:**

1. Retrieves a list of models using `genai.list_models`.
2. Extracts the model names and logs them for reference.
3. Handles errors during the process.

**Key Logic:** Helps developers understand what AI models are available for use. 

**Function: get_clean_text**

```python
def get_clean_text(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            text = file.read()
        return text
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logging.error(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        return None

```

**Purpose:** Reads cleaned data from a file and returns it as a string.

**Parameters:**

* `file_path`: The location of the file containing cleaned text.

**Steps:**

1. Opens and reads the file content.
2. Returns the content or handles file read errors by logging them.

**Key Logic:** Provides a single access point to retrieve the knowledge base for AI processing.

**Function: generate_embeddings**

```python
def generate_embeddings(content, chunk_size=2000):
    model_name = "models/text-embedding-004"
    embeddings = []

    for i in range(0, len(content), chunk_size):
        chunk = content[i:i + chunk_size]
        try:
            chunk_embeddings = genai.embed_content(content=chunk, model=model_name)
            embeddings.append(chunk_embeddings)
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error embedding content: {e}")
            return None

    return embeddings

```

**Purpose:** Generates embeddings for chunks of content using a text embedding model.

**Parameters:**

* `content`: Text content that needs to be embedded.
* `chunk_size`: The size of each chunk for processing (default is 2000 characters).

**Steps:**

1. Splits the content into smaller chunks for embedding.
2. Uses `genai.embed_content` to generate embeddings for each chunk.
3. Handles errors and logs any embedding failures.

**Key Logic:** Handles large content efficiently by processing in smaller parts.

**Function: generate_response**

```python
def generate_response(user_question, cleaned_text):
    try:
        prompt = f"""Using the knowledge base, answer the following question: 
'{user_question}'. Here is the information: {cleaned_text}. Try to be relevant and answer to 
some vague questions also. If you cannot find anything in the context document try to generate 
it by yourself. 
        If someone asks who are you, then answer that you are the 'your onboarding buddy'. 
        Act professional and friendly but be sweet at the same time."""
        response = model.generate_content([prompt])
        return response.text if hasattr(response, 'text') else "No response content found."
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error generating response: {e}")
        return "An error occurred while generating the response."

```

**Purpose:** Similar to `app.py`, generates a response based on user input but with a slightly different prompt. Handles onboarding scenarios as well.

**Parameters:**

* `user_question`: The user's question.
* `cleaned_text`: Knowledge base data.

**Key Logic:** Emphasizes user-friendliness and onboarding assistance.

**Function: main**

```python
def main():
    file_path = "C:/Users/mahan/OneDrive/Desktop/GenAIus/Preetha/AllCleanData.txt"
    text = get_clean_text(file_path)
    if not text:
        print("File not found or could not be read.")
        return

    embeddings = generate_embeddings(text)
    if embeddings:
        print("Embeddings generated successfully.")
    else:
        print("Failed to generate embeddings.")

```

**Purpose:** Orchestrates the primary operations like reading the knowledge base and generating embeddings.

**Steps:**

1. Retrieves cleaned text using `get_clean_text`.
2. Generates embeddings for the content.
3. Provides console output based on success or failure.

**Key Logic:** A high-level overview of essential backend processes.

**ii) Privacy of Confidential Information**

- In our ongoing commitment to safeguarding sensitive corporate information, we plan to leverage Google Vertex AI. This initiative will utilize advanced machine learning capabilities, particularly through the Gemini model, to ensure privacy and security while handling confidential data.
- Gemini Model: By using Gemini, we will implement function calling mechanisms that allow the system to interact with real-time APIs without exposing sensitive information. This model supports large language models (LLMs) that can effectively perform real-time data retrieval without the typical limitations associated with traditional models.
- Tenant Project Architecture: The architecture will be designed to accommodate tenant-based implementations, where different tenants (or clients) can utilize the system while ensuring that their data remains separate and secure. Each tenant will have distinct access controls, allowing for customized experiences while maintaining robust data protection measures.
- Reasoning Engine: A robust reasoning engine will be integrated to facilitate logical processing and decision-making capabilities. This engine will analyze user queries in real-time and determine the best course of action, ensuring that responses are both accurate and contextually relevant.
- Multi-Agent System: The multi-agent framework will allow multiple instances of the chatbot to operate concurrently, each handling different aspects of user queries. This design will enable the system to respond more effectively to a variety of requests simultaneously, enhancing overall responsiveness and user satisfaction.
- Data Security: Utilizing Vertex AI not only supports efficient data processing but also strengthens data security protocols. The implementation of stringent privacy measures will ensure that confidential information remains protected during API calls and data exchanges, adhering to the principles of tenant-based security.
- Exploring Functionality: As we dive deeper into the integration of Vertex AI, we will explore how it can support additional functionalities, such as:
    - Natural language understanding for more nuanced user interactions.
    - Advanced contextual awareness, allowing the model to retain and refer to past conversations while respecting privacy constraints.
    - Enhanced feedback mechanisms for continuous learning and improvement.

These initiatives represent a significant step forward in enhancing the functionality, security, and user experience of the GenAIus KT system. By prioritizing real-time data access and the protection of confidential information, we are committed to developing a robust and user-friendly knowledge management system.

**10. Conclusion**

The GenAIus KT project successfully implemented a professional Knowledge Management System using AI technology, focusing on user-friendly interaction and accurate response generation. The adherence to SDLC principles ensured a systematic approach to development, making the system reliable and scalable for future enhancements.

**Explanation:**

1. **Imports and Configuration:**
   - Imports the necessary libraries: `Flask`, `CORS`, `logging`, `os`, `dotenv`, `google.generativeai`, `markdown`, `numpy`, `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`.
   - Configures basic logging to print informational messages and above.
   - Initializes a Flask app instance and enables CORS.
   - Loads the Google API key from a `.env` file using `dotenv`.

2. **Model Initialization:**
   - Creates a `genai.GenerativeModel` instance using the "gemini-1.5-flash" model.

3. **Loading and Preprocessing Data:**
   - Loads the cleaned text from a file.
   - Defines the `generate_embeddings` function to create embeddings for the cleaned text using the "models/text-embedding-004" model.
   - Generates embeddings for the entire cleaned text once at server startup.

4. **Finding Relevant Chunk:**
   - Defines the `find_relevant_chunk` function:
     - Embeds the user's question using the same embedding model.
     - Calculates cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings of all text chunks.
     - Returns the text chunk with the highest cosine similarity (most relevant).

5. **Generating Response:**
   - Defines the `generate_response` function:
     - Finds the relevant chunk for the user's question.
     - Creates a prompt for the Gemini model that includes the user's question and the relevant chunk.
     - Uses the `model.generate_content` method to generate a response based on the prompt.
     - Converts the response to HTML using `markdown`.

6. **API Endpoint:**
   - Defines the `/api/chat` endpoint that handles POST requests:
     - Retrieves the user's message from the request body.
     - Generates a response using `generate_response`.
     - Converts the response to HTML using `markdown`.
     - Returns the HTML response to the frontend.

7. **Running the Application:**
   - Runs the Flask app in debug mode, allowing the app to reload automatically when changes are made.

**Key Points:**

- **Contextualized Responses:** The code uses cosine similarity and embedding models to retrieve the most relevant context from the cleaned text before generating responses.
- **Markdown to HTML:** The response from the Gemini model is converted to HTML using Markdown for better display in the frontend.
- **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented throughout the code, including catching exceptions during embedding generation and response generation.

**Further Improvements:**

- **More Sophisticated Embedding Model:** Consider using a more powerful embedding model for better context relevance.
- **Fine-tuning the Model:** You could fine-tune the Gemini model on a dataset specifically related to the chatbot's domain for even better performance.
- **More Robust Error Handling:** Implement more comprehensive error handling and logging to provide better debugging information.
- **Chat History and Session Management:** Implement logic for managing chat history and potentially user sessions if needed.
